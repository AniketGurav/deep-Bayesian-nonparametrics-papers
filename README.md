# deep-Bayesian-nonparametrics
The collection of papers about combining deep learning with Bayesian nonparametrics

  I made a concise name "deep Bayesian non-parametrics"(DBNP) to a series of work bringing the fields of deep learning and Bayesian non-parametrics together. Generally, not only DBNP means combining the neural networks with stochastic processes in Bayesian modelling, but also leveraging common and effective structures designed in deep learning, such as convolution, recurrence and deep stacked layers in Bayesian non-parameterics setting. Meanwhile, corresponding training methods designed for these models, especially approximate inference, are also our concerns.
